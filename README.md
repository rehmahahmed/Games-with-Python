# Games-with-Python
Games big and small, developed with Python.
There are Two games directed by the course- Hacking and Poke the dots. Instructions are in their respective files.
Note- Both the games need uagame.py module to run.
Hacking game has 2 versions - 
Version 7 is as directed from the course whereas version 8 has a couple of small additions I made to the game. I recommend to play Version 8 for better expirience. Enjoy!
